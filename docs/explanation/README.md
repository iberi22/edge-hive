# 💡 Explanation - Understanding Oriented

> **"Understand the why"** - Context, background, and design thinking

## What is Explanation?

Explanation is **discursive documentation**. It explores topics, provides context, and deepens understanding.

### When to read explanation

- ✅ You want to understand design decisions
- ✅ You're curious about "why" something works that way
- ✅ You want to see the bigger picture
- ✅ You're away from your computer (reading in the bath!)

### What explanation is NOT

- ❌ Step-by-step instructions (see [How-To](../how-to/))
- ❌ Learning exercises (see [Tutorials](../tutorials/))
- ❌ Technical specifications (see [Reference](../reference/))

## Explanation Principles (Diátaxis)

Our explanations follow these guidelines:

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Understanding-oriented** | Clarify, don't instruct |
| **Theoretical** | Concepts and ideas |
| **Context-rich** | History, alternatives, trade-offs |
| **Discursive** | Explore topics freely |
| **Opinion-friendly** | Design rationale matters |
| **Connective** | Link ideas together |

### Expected Experience

When reading explanation, you should:

- ✅ Gain insight into design decisions
- ✅ See connections between concepts
- ✅ Understand trade-offs
- ✅ Form your own informed opinions

## Explanation Format

Explanations use narrative structure:

```markdown
# Topic Name

## Context
Historical background or motivation

## The Problem
What challenge does this address?

## Design Rationale
Why this solution?

## Alternatives Considered
What else was evaluated?

## Trade-offs
What did we gain? What did we sacrifice?

## Related Concepts
- Links to other explanations
- External resources
```

### Writing Style

Explanation allows for:

- 📝 First-person ("We chose X because...")
- 💭 Opinion ("This approach is better when...")
- 🔄 Alternatives ("You could also...")
- 📖 History ("Initially, we...")
- 🔗 External references
